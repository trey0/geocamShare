The GeoCam Project helps disaster responders get information faster by
sharing maps, photos, and other data using their mobile devices.  The
GeoCam team is part of the `NASA Ames Intelligent Robotics Group`_, and the
project is funded by Google.  To best serve the wide range of public
safety agencies, NGOs, and citizen responders, GeoCam software is
released open source and interoperates using open standards.

GeoCam Share, our software platform, currently includes the following
apps:

 * GeoCam Lens: Share photos taken on your cell phone, tagged with
   position and which way the camera was pointed. Add notes, select an
   icon to appear in the map, and queue the photo for automatic upload
   when a data network becomes available.  (Web app and native app for
   Android mobile devices.)

 * GeoCam Track: View live position of your team members as reported
   by the GPS in their mobile devices.  (Web app and native app for
   Android mobile devices.)

This ``geocamShare`` repository holds the web app components of the
GeoCam Share app collection.  The native Android apps are in a separate
repository called ``geocamMobileForAndroid``.  To see the master copy of
all our repositories, visit http://github.com/geocam .
